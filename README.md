# Predicting the Progress of Vehicle Development Projects using an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder Model

## Abstract
The automotive industry is facing a technological transformation. 
Increasing requirements from customers, markets and the law are raising the complexity of its products. 
As the car evolves into a “smartphone on wheels”, its development engineers are facing unprecedented challenges. 
The growing technical product complexity is also pushing conventional project management methods to their limits. 
This results in changed constraints, which make it all the more necessary to predict the course of a vehicle development project, in advance. 
The use of deep learning methods offers great potential here. 
The goal of this paper is to predict the course of vehicle development projects. 
One of the major challenges are the nonlinearity and aperiodicity of the multivariate data resulting from short- and long-term dynamic behaviour. 
In order to address these challenges, we apply different state-of-the-art methods for multivariate time series prediction onto a real-world dataset and compare as well as evaluate the results quantitatively. 
As result, we propose a multilevel attention-based seq2seq prediction model for multivariate time series. 
With this work we lay the foundation for the early detection of deviations from an ideal project course and thereby contribute to the virtual validation of vehicle development projects.

## Requirements
You will just need a current working version of Python 3.7 and the inline mentioned libraries.
